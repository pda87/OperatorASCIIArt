# OperatorASCIIArt

This was originally a challenge on Stack Exchange "Programming Puzzles & Code Golf: 

http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/98890/operator-ascii-art

It takes one of 5 Mathematical Operators ('+', '=', '-', '/' or 'x') and an integer - 'n' - and draws corresponding ASCII art the size of 'n'.

I'm planning to re-write this in JavaScript so I can use it on my website.
